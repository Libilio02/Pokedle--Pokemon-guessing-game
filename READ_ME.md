Hey there! I´m Liberto, I have just started my informatic engineering degree, and this is the first proyect I´ve been working on. I know that it´s not much, and it isn´t anything, but I found it funny and had to try to make this game on my own via python, which I considered really brave, as I have been programming for just a month now. The code isn´t perfect either, there are still some bugs I will be working on on the next few days, and also implementing some new features
