Hey there! I´m Liberto, I have just started my informatic engineering degree, and this is the first proyect I´ve been working on. I know that it´s not much, and it isn´t anything, but I found it funny and had to try to make this game on my own via python, which I considered really brave, as I have been programming for just a month now. The code isn´t perfect either, there are still some bugs I will be working on on the next few days, and also implementing some new features (such as temporal files and logs for the images of the pokemons, which I haven´t been able to do yet). 
Shoutout to arnavb for the pypokedex library (https://github.com/arnavb/pypokedex)
#=========================================================
Dependences needed: pypokedex, requests, and PIL
P.S.: right now, as I haven´t be able to use temporal files for the program, the whole empty file is needed, so that the program is right newt to a archive called output, which contains a log.txt and an image archive.
